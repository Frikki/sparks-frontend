## Status

**Proposed** | ~~Accepted~~ | ~~Depreciated~~ | ~~Superceded~~

## Context

Some features require from the input from various areas of sparks. It is useful to have gathered in a single versioned document the latest functional specifications relevant to a given feature as a conversational tool. It is cheaper to modify the document beforehand than the implementation after the fact.

This document in addition doubles as a base for test writing, as the tests should be written against those specifications.

This document should be short, to the point, updated and versioned.
 
The proposed features described in the document can be prioritized against  their value added (MUST/MAY/NICE TO HAVE etc.). This allows arbitraging features implementation during unavoidable time-crunches. (cf. http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2007/10/26.html)

Lastly this document can serve as an entry to any programmer in the development team to quickly enter the code base related to the feature at hand.
