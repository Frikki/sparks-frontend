## Context

TODO

Then there are some edge cases to think about. If the user is already logged-in, and then click on the reset password email link, should we let him proceed? Is there a possibility that one user would be logged in on a computer, goes to take a coffee, a second user comes in on that same computer and clicks on the reset password link in his email, should we let him? Or should we log out the current user first? Do we even care?
